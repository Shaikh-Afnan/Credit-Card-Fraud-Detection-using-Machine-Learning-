# 📊 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📄 Description

This is my final year project on **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**.
The project aims to build and evaluate predictive models that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.
It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, testing, and evaluation** using real-world anonymized data.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
✅ Implementation of multiple ML algorithms:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* (others as applicable)
  ✅ Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
  ✅ Comparison of models and visualization of results

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **[Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)** from Kaggle, which contains anonymized transaction data over two days with \~284,000 transactions.

---

## 📈 Results

* Achieved high precision and recall on fraudulent transactions.
* ROC-AUC score of approximately: *X.XX* (fill in your result).
